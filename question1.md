In this project, a front-end web application called "Text Analyzer" was developed using React. The application goes beyond simple text drafting and formatting. It allows users to analyze and manipulate text. A JSON file was utilized to add alert messages with different types (success, warning). The application is designed to be user-friendly, and with just one click of a button, it can convert text according to the user's needs.

Project 2: Touch Typing Game | React, JavaScript Feb. 2023 – Feb. 2023
The second project involved the creation of an interactive touch-typing game using React and JavaScript. The aim of the game is to improve users' typing skills and speed in a fun and captivating manner. The developers utilized modern web development technologies to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. Additionally, the game was designed with responsive web design principles in mind, making it adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.

###### Q2. What did the system do?
Ans. In summary, the system developed front-end web applications using React and JavaScript, added functionalities to analyze text and create interactive touch typing games, and ensured a user-friendly experience with responsive design considerations.

###### Q3. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?
Ans. DevOps and full Stack development

###### Q4. How do you approach the development problem?
